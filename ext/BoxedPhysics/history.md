# What is BoxedPhysics?
BoxedPhysics is an extension by Pooiod7 for PenguinMod that allows for the advanced manipulation of physics objects using the Box2D phsysics library. It has features such as spring joints and sliders.

The primary motivation behind creating BoxedPhysics was to overcome the limitations in existing physics extensions for Scratch3. These extensions often lacked the advanced functionalities that were present in older ScratchX extensions. BoxedPhysics was cerated to reintroduce and expand upon these capabilities, providing PenguinMod users with a more robust and versatile toolset for creating dynamic simulations.

# Origins and Evolution
Work on BoxedPhysics began on October 16, 2023, starting as a port of [Griffpatch’s Box 2D extension](http://griffpatch.github.io/Box2D.js-Scratch2-Extension/GriffpatchBox2D.v0.3.js) for ScratchX under the name "Box2D Extension". 
As it developed the name changed 2 more times, becoming “Box Physics” on January 28, 2024, then “Box2D Physics” on January 30 2024. 
The initial public testing version, released on October 19, 2023, at 10:42 AM, under the name “Advanced Box2D (unsandboxed),”

The early development of BoxedPhysics took place on Replit along with many other early extensions by pooiod7, but due to negative platform changes and overall instability, development was moved to Github and VS Code.
While some early projects that used BoxedPhysics became unusable, this change allowed for improved hosting and long-term stability.
